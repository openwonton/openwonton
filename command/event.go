Usage: wonton event <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command groups subcommands for interacting with OpenWonton event sinks.
  OpenWonton's event sinks system can be used to subscribe to the event stream
  for events that match specific topics.

  Register or update an event sink:

      $ cat sink.json
      {
        "ID": "my-sink",
        "Type": "webhook",
        "Address": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
        "Topics": {
          "*": ["*"]
        }
      }
      $ wonton event sink register sink.json
      Successfully registered "my-sink" event sink!

  List event sinks:

      $ wonton event sink list
      ID         Type     Address           Topics    LatestIndex
      my-sink    webhook  http://127.0.0.1  *[*]      0

  Deregister an event sink:

      $ wonton event sink deregister my-sink
      Successfully deregistered "my-sink" event sink!

  Please see the individual subcommand help for detailed usage information.
